\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Preliminary ideas}
A brainstorming chart was created to get an insight into each idea suggest for evaluation.
15 ideas were listed and described buy these categories: mechanical challenges, electronics challenges, 
software challeges, components, potential market, cost, machine learning, sponsorship potential, user safety.
Each cathegory consisted from 1 to 5 informations.

\section{Market research}
Before the requirments and workcycle was determind  there was an analysis of  4 different companies that are producing unmanned life saving boats or buys. The analysis is consisting of short description and a table comparing technical specification. All the data will be used during the requirement writing, so that the product is capable of potential competition on the market.
\subsection{Emilly boat }
It is 127 cm long boat with a buy covering the top of the boat. It controlled by RC and a rope can be attached to it in order to get it back on shore after being deployed. It has 4 other modifications, police, sonar, man over board and swift water. It is powered by one motor that is also used for steering.
\subsection{Hover Ark H3}
It is Remote controlled Lifesaving buoy controlled by RC with the function of an automatic return in case of lost signal. It has and upgraded version with lights for better visibility. It is capable of transporting the rescued person back to the shore,but he/she has to be able grab on it. 
\subsection{Orca H9}
Livesaving watercraft that is the most powerful from all the products listed. It is manned vehicle that can carry a single lifeguard and carry or drag the victim back to the shore.Its is powered by one water jet engine.Compared to the jetski is more compact and needs less power.
\subsection{Dolphin 1}
The look and usage of this lifesaving buoy is similar to Hover Ark H3. Except that it has an extra camera in the front and is a bit larger.
\subsection {Water Rescue Stretcher Bed}
It is the extended and more powerful version of Dolphin 1. Between its two propellers is located the stretcher bed onto which the person can be placed and does not have hold it during the transportation.

\subsection{Conclusion}
After the investigation was concluded that all of the products has to be navigated by person to the victim. 
Only Hover ark is capable of an automatic return. Therefore there is a space for extended functionality of navigation to the victim or to a lifeguard as an assistance.

\section{Product requirements}
After evaluation of user requirements , university requirements, given time and budget, project requirements were created and divided 
into 2 groups. Need to have requirements are formulated in a way that the final product should be a fully working downscaled prototype. 
They are giving detailed insight into the techical characteristics and functionality. Nice to 
have requirements are decribing the full scale prototype with extensions that fulfills all the user requirements.
\subsection{Need to have requirements}
\begin {enumerate}
\item Body shape 
    \begin {enumerate}
    \item Should contain a stretcher bed between the two kiels. 
    \\Reason: help the lifeguard wit the transportation
    \item Should have 2 handles on the back and 1 on each side.
    \\Reason:useful when loading person and serving as buoy 
    \item Should be painted in a bright visible colour regulated by the law.
    \\Reson: better visibility and law restrictions
    \item 
    \end {enumerate}
\end {enumerate}
\begin {enumerate}
\item Speed and endurance 
    \begin {enumerate}
    \item Minimum speed to the person should be 1.1 m/s
    \\Reason: maximum distance/3sec
    \item Should be able to run for 10 minutes withou recharging
    \\Reason: The weight and price of the battery
    \item Should be able to carry 50 kg load on the way back
    \\ Reason: the maximum payload 150 kg / 3. Using 1/3 of the motorpower
    \end {enumerate}
\end {enumerate}
\begin {enumerate}
\item Navigation 
    \begin {enumerate}
    \item Should use a gps with presision of 3 m 
    \\Reason: price of the models with the highest precision
    \item Should be able to receive signal in range of 200 m
    \\Reason:largest distance desired by user
    \item Should have a compass to determine the orientation 
    \\Reason: determine the orientation of the boat
    \item Should be able to detect obstacles with sonar
    \\ Reason: requirement by the university
    \end {enumerate}
\end {enumerate}
