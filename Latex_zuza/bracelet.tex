\section{Bracelet}
The bracelet is the part of project that is supposed to secure the PCB.\\
Short description about the idea behind (to learn more read about the PCB design for the bracelet in electronics chapter):\\
The button in the bracelet is pressed by the lifeguard, then the coordinates of the lifeguard are sent to the boat.\\
The bracelet should be as small as possible. It cannot handicap the lifefguard during swimming as well as during saving the drowning person.
The recuirements for the project were to designa PCB. The bracelet described in this report is a prototype.\\
The prototype is too big to be used normally. However, it was designed to be as small as possible in respect to the PCB and battery size.\\
The design consists of 4 main components:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Top cover. This is the part printed from TPU. It makes pressing the button from the PCB possible. Also if anyone hits the top
    of the bracelet it makes less harm, than PLA would. 
    \item Bottom cover. This part had to be done from harder than TPU material, because it has to have the watch bracelet attached to it.
    It makes it not as safe as needed, but because it is a prototype it is acceptable.
\end{itemize}
